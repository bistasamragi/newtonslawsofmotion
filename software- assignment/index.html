      <h3>The three laws of motion:</h3>

      <p>Newton’s laws of motion, contains three statements that explaint the relationship between a physical object and the forces acting upon it. The laws of motion were created by the pysicist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

      <p>In 1686, Newton presented his three laws of motion in the “Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis.”</p>

      <p>By developing his three laws of motion, Newton revolutionized science. Newton’s laws together with Kepler’s Laws explained why planets move in elliptical orbits rather than in circles. (Nasa 2022).</p>

      <h3>Sir Isaac Newton:</h3>
      
      <p>Isaac Newton was born 4 January 1643 in the United Kingdom, he was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer and coined many other titles during his lifetime. He is best know for his theory about the law gravity that he discovered after watching an apple fall, through his dicovery about the three laws of motion greatly influenced the the Enlightentment of Europe.</p>
